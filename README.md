## Description

Crafting a comprehensive README is crucial for effective project development, providing users with insights into the creation process and avenues for potential enhancements. However, the task of creating a polished README can be daunting, especially when faced with the pressure to deliver a stellar document. The README Generator streamlines this process, simplifying the layout creation. The generator asks probing questions to get you started then pre-fills the responses to a newly generated README.md file. Users can easily locate this file and make direct modifications, such as uploading screenshots, organizing links, and correcting any errors. Refer to the usage section for a tutorial on the functionality of the README Generator.

## Installation

In order to use the README Generator, it is necessary to have a code editor, such as Visual Studio Code (VSCode), and Node.js installed on your system.

1. Begin by installing Node.js on your computer's terminal/commmand-line. For detailed installation instructions, vist <a href='https://nodejs.org/en'>Node.js.org</a>.

2. Verify the installation of npm, which usually comes bundled with Node.js. Execute the command `npm -v` in your terminal/commmand-line to confirm that you have the latest version downloaded.

## Usage

The following steps outline the usage of the README Generator. Ensure that you have satisfied all installation requirements before proceeding with the following usage instructions.

1. Initiate the cloning process from the GitHub repository by selecting "Clone." Execute the Git Clone command in your terminal/commmand-line. Next, open the cloned project in your preferred code editor.

2. Execute the command `node [current file.file type]` in your terminal, replacing `[current file.file type]` with the appropriate file name and type. For instance, the command may look like: `node index.js`.

3. The instructions will promptly populate; after reviewing, type 'Y' to proceed.

4. Respond to each probing question as prompted. If you recognize an error in your response after pressing enter and advancing to the next question, rest assured that you can make all necessary modifications once the README.md file has been generated.

5. Upon completing the questionnaire, the terminal will confirm the successful generation of the README with the message "Your README has been generated!" <br> You can now locate the README.md file in the same directory as your initial command. For example, if your initial command was `node index.js`, the README.md file will be located in the same folder as your index.js file.

6. After generating the README.md, relocate the file to the designated folder within your corresponding project. You have the option to retain a local copy of this cloned repository on your computer for convenient future use. Alternatively, if necessary, you can remove the cloned repository from your computer and re-clone it as needed.
